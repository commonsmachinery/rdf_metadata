RDFMetadata architecture
========================

This directory contains some drawings describing how the RDF parser
and model fits together.  All drawings are done in
[UMLet](http://www.umlet.com/) and exported as PNGs.

Contents:

* package-overview: how the modules fit together, listing their public
  interfaces and access/notification
* model-repr-dom: detailed drawings of the model->domrepr->dom objects
  and links created for representative RDF/XML documents.
